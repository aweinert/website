I am currently working at the [German Aerospace Center](https://www.dlr.de) at the lab for [Simulation and Software Technology](https://www.dlr.de/sc).
There, we are developing the [Remote Component Environment](https://www.rcenvironment.de), a tool for development of distributed, data-driven workflows, that is currently mainly used in the early stages of airplane design.
The tool itself is open source, so feel free to [have a look](https://github.com/rcenvironment).
Moreover, we are always looking for [new colleagues](https://www.dlr.de/dlr/jobs/en/desktopdefault.aspx#SimulationsSoftwaretechnik/S:142).

Previously, I have been a Ph.D. student with the
[Reactive Systems Group](http://react.uni-saarland.de) at
[Saarland University](http://uni-saarland.de)
under the supervision of [Martin Zimmermann](http://react.uni-saarland.de/people/zimmermann.html).

Before that I have been a student at [RWTH Aachen University](http://www.rwth-aachen.de),
where I received my master's degree with a thesis written under supervision of
[Prof. J&uuml;rgen Giesl](http://verify.rwth-aachen.de/giesl/).
I have received my Bachelor's degree from the same university, when I worked at the [chair](http://moves.rwth-aachen.de) of
[Prof. Joost-Pieter Katoen](http://www-i2.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/~katoen).
You can find both my theses under [Publications](/publications/).

During a semester abroad at [UC Berkeley](http://berkeley.edu/index.html) I also worked on
[automatatutor.com](http://www.automatatutor.com), which helps instructors and students in both teaching
and learning basic concepts in automata theory.
You can read more about it under [Projects](/projects/).
