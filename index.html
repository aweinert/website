	<p> I am a Ph.D. student with the
	<a href="http://react.uni-saarland.de">Reactive Systems Group</a> at
	<a href="http://uni-saarland.de">Saarland University</a>
	under the supervision of <a href="http://react.uni-saarland.de/people/zimmermann.html">Martin Zimmermann</a>.

	<p>
	Before that I have been a student at <a href="http://www.rwth-aachen.de">RWTH Aachen University</a>,
	where I received my master's degree with a thesis written under supervision of
	<a href="http://verify.rwth-aachen.de/giesl/">Prof. J&uuml;rgen Giesl</a>.
	I have received my Bachelor's degree from the same university, when I worked at
	<a href="http://www-i2.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/~katoen">Prof. Joost-Pieter Katoen</a>'s 
	<a href="http://moves.rwth-aachen.de">chair</a>.
	You can find both my theses under <a href="/papers/">Papers</a>.
	</p>

	<p>
	During a semester abroad at <a href="http://berkeley.edu/index.html">UC Berkeley</a> I also worked on
	<a href="http://www.automatatutor.com">automatatutor.com</a>, which helps instructors and students in both teaching
	and learning basic concepts in automata theory.
	You can read more about it under <a href="/projects/">Projects</a>.
