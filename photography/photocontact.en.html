<h1> How to get full-scale photos without watermarks </h1>
The photos on this page are scaled down and watermarked for presentation.
If you would like to have any of them without the watermark and in their original resolution, e.g., for printing and framing, feel free to contact me via any of the channels to the right.
</p>

<p>
Also, these photos are just a subjective selection of the photos I have taken.
If I have taken your picture somewhere and you would like to get it in full resolution, please send me an email.
